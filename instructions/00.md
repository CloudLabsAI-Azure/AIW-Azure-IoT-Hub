# Exercise 1: Getting Started with Azure IoT Services

## Scenario

*Turbine (devices)* are deployed across the globe. You need to configure the solution to receive telemetry and manage all the devices centrally in a reliable/scalable fashion.

## Overview

In this exercise, you will connect devices deployed across the globe to Azure IoT Hub and manage all the devices centrally in a reliable/scalable fashion and, configure the solution to receive telemetry.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

* Login to Azure Portal and verify the existing/pre-deployed resources
* Explore the IoT Hub service
* Connect device (simulated) to Azure IoT Hub
* Verify telemetry stream from Azure IoT Hub

## Instructions

### Getting Started with Lab

1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) on the left and lab guide on the right will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab.

1. To get the lab environment details, you can select the **Lab Environment** tab on the right. Additionally, the credentials will also be emailed to your email address provided during registration.

 > You will see Suffix/DeploymentID value on **Lab Environment** tab, use it wherever you see SUFFIX or DeploymentID in lab steps.
 
#### Task 1: Log in to Azure Portal and verify the existing/pre-deployed resources

1. In the JumpVM, click on the Azure portal shortcut of the Microsoft Edge browser which is created on the desktop.

   ![azure portal.](media/azureportal.png)  

1. On **Sign in to Microsoft Azure** blade, you will see a login screen, in that enter following email/username and then click on **Next**. 
   * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

1. Now enter the following password and click on **Sign in**.
   * Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

1. If you see the pop-up **Stay Signed in?**, click No

1. If you see the pop-up **You have free Azure Advisor recommendations!**, close the window to continue the lab.

1. If a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** popup window appears, click **Maybe Later** to skip the tour.
   
1. In the upper left corner of the portal window, to open the Azure portal menu, click the hamburger menu icon.

    At the top of the portal menu, you should see a section containing four menu options:

    * The **Create a resource** button opens a page displaying the services available through the Azure Marketplace, many of which provide free options. Notice that services are grouped by technology, including "Internet of Things", and that a search box is provided.
    
    * The **Home** button opens a customized page that displays links to Azure services, your recently accessed services, and other tools.
    
    * The **Dashboard** button opens a page displaying your default (or most recently used) dashboard. 

    * The **All services** button opens a page similar to the **Create a resource** button described above.

1. On the Azure portal menu, click **Resource groups**

    This blade displays all of the resource groups that you have access to the Azure subscription.

1. From the list, select **iot-{deployment-id}** and explore through the pre-created resources that are available in the resource group.

#### Task 2: Explore the IoT Hub service

**Azure IoT Hub** - IoT Hub is a managed service, hosted in the cloud, that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud-hosted solution backend. You can connect virtually any device to IoT Hub.

1. In the resource group, select the existing IoT Hub named **iothub-{deployment-id}**.

1. On the left-side menu, under **Explorers**, click **IoT devices**

    This pane can be used to add, modify, and delete devices registered to your hub. You will get pretty familiar with this pane by the end of this lab.

1. On the left-side menu, near the top, click **Activity log** to view logs that can be used to review activities and diagnose issues. You can also define queries that help with routine tasks.

1. On the left-side menu, under **Settings**, click **Built-in endpoints**

    IoT Hub exposes "endpoints" that enable external connections. Essentially, an endpoint is anything connected to or communicating with your IoT Hub. You should see that your hub already has two endpoints defined:

    * _Events_
    * _Cloud to device messaging_

1. On the left-side menu, under **Messaging**, click **Message routing**

    The IoT Hub message routing feature enables you to route incoming device-to-cloud messages to service endpoints such as Azure Storage containers, Event Hubs, and Service Bus queues. You can also create routing rules to perform query-based routes.

1. At the top of the **Message routing** pane, click **Custom endpoints**.

    Custom endpoints (such as Service Bus queue and Storage) are often used within an IoT implementation.

1. Take a minute to scan through the menu options under **Settings**

    > **Note**:  This task is only intended to be an introduction to the IoT Hub service and get you more comfortable with the UI, so don't worry if you feel a bit overwhelmed at this point. You will be configuring and managing your IoT Hub, devices, and communications as this course continue.
    
#### Task 3: Connect Turbine device (simulated) to Azure IoT Hub

In this task, you will connect the Turbine Devices to Azure IoT Hub.

1. Get the IotHubConnectionString from the **Environment Details** Tab or you can obtain the connection string by going into IoT Hub, click **Shared Access policies** under settings and then click **iothubowner** under Policy Tab and copy the **Connection string - primarykey** value to establish a connection between IoT hub and the Simulator App.

1. Minimize the azure portal and open the **IoT Simulator App** by clicking on the **IoT simulator** shortcut that is there on the virtual machine desktop. 

1. Paste the **Connection string** value which you copied earlier in the textbox.

1. Click **Connect** button on the right to establish a connection with IoT Hub.

1. Once the connection is successful, you will see a pop-up message **Connection Successful** and you will be able to see the list of simulated devices. 

   ![Iot devices](media/connect.png)
   
1. Click on **Register** which is next to the **turbine-01** on the IoT Simulator app dialog to register the device to the IoT Hub.

   ![Iot devices](media/register.png)

1. Minimize the **IoT Hub Simulator App** and navigate to the **Iot hub**.

1. Click **IoT devices** under Explorers section and you can observe the registered IoT devices we have registered in the above instruction.
 
   ![Iot devices](media/iotdevice02.png)

1. Click on **Activate** to simulate changing the device status from disabled to enabled in the IoT Hub Registry.

   ![Iot devices](media/iotdevice01.png)
    
      > **Note: Repeat the above steps to register and activate all the devices**.

1. At this point, you have registered and activated devices. To view this list of devices, Switch over to the Azure Portal and select the IoT Hub **iot-hub-{deployment-id}** .

1. From the IoT Hub blade, select IoT Devices under Explorers on the left-hand menu.

1. You should see all the devices listed, with the ones that you activated having a status of enabled.

1. Click on **Send Telemetry**. Within a few moments, the grid on the bottom will list each telemetry message transmitted and the simulated temperature value.

#### Task 4: Verify telemetry stream from Azure IoT Hub

In this task, you will use the Azure CLI to verify telemetry sent by the simulated device is being received by Azure IoT Hub.

1. Open the Azure Cloud Shell by navigating to **https://shell.azure.com**. Log in using your Azure subscription credentials if prompted to do so, select a **PowerShell** session, and accept any prompts or click the Cloud Shell button on the azure portal toolbar ![](media/cloudshell01.png)

1. If you got a prompt for creating storage account, click on **Show advanced settings** and select existing Resource Group as **iot-{deployment-id}** and enter **iotstore{deployment-id}** for storage account name and Enter **blob** for File Share 

   >**Note**: - You can get the **deployment-id** details from your environment details page.
        
   ![Azure portal screenshot showing the select path to create a storage account.](media/storageiot.png)

1. In the Azure Cloud Shell, enter the following command to install **Azure-IoT** extension:

    ```cmd/sh
    az extension add --name azure-iot
    ```

1. In the Azure Cloud Shell, to monitor the event messages that are being received by your IoT hub, enter the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    az iot hub monitor-events --hub-name {IoTHubName} --device-id {Device ID}
    ```

    > **Note**: Be sure to replace both the **{IoTHubName}** and **{Device ID}** placeholder with the name of your Azure IoT Hub and with the Device ID like **turbine-01**

    > **Note**:  If you receive a message stating _"Dependency update required for IoT extension version"_ when running the Azure CLI command, then press `y` to accept the update and press `Enter`. This will allow the command to continue as expected.

    The `monitor-events` command (within the `az iot hub` Azure CLI module) offers the capability to monitor device telemetry and other message types sent to an Azure IoT Hub. This can be a very useful tool during code development, and the convenience of the command-line interface is also nice.

    The `--device-id` parameter is optional and allows you to monitor the events from a single device. If the parameter is omitted, the command will monitor all events sent to the specified Azure IoT Hub.

1. Notice that the `az iot hub monitor-events` Azure CLI command outputs a JSON representation of the events that are arriving at your specified Azure IoT Hub. 

    This command enables you to monitor the events being sent to the IoT hub. You are also verifying that the device is able to connect to and communicate with your IoT hub.

    You should see messages displayed that are similar to the following:

    ```cmd/sh
    Starting event monitor, filtering on the device: turbine-01, use ctrl-c to stop...
    {
        "event": {
            "origin": "turbine-01",
            "module": "",
            "interface": "",
            "component": "",
            "payload": "{\"id\":\"turbine-01\",\"time\":\"2020-08-14T12:50:48.4702636Z\",\"temp\":69.0}"
        }
    }
    ```

1. Once you have verified that IoT hub is receiving the telemetry, press **Ctrl-C** in the Azure Cloud Shell.

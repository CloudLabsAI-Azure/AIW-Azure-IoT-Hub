# Getting Started with Azure IoT Services

## Scenario

*Turbine (devices)* are deployed across the globe. You need to configure the solution to receive telemetry and manage all the devices centrally in a reliable/scalable fashion.

In this exercise, you will connect devices deployed across the globe to Azure IoT Hub and manage all the devices centrally in a reliable/scalable fashion and, configure the solution to receive telemetry.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

* Login to Azure Portal and verify the existing/pre-deployed resources
* Examine features of the IoT Hub service
* Connect device (simulated) to Azure IoT Hub
* Verify telemetry stream from Azure IoT Hub

## Instructions

### Getting Started with Lab

1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) on the left and lab guide on the right will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab.

1. To get the lab environment details, you can select the **Lab Environment** tab on the right. Additionally, the credentials will also be emailed to your email address provided during registration.

    At the top of the portal menu, you should see a section containing four menu options:

    * The **Home** button opens a customized page that displays links to Azure services, your recently accessed services, and other tools.
    
    * The **Dashboard** button opens a page displaying your default (or most recently used) dashboard. 

    * The **All services** button opens a page similar to the **Create a resource** button described above.

1. On the Azure portal menu, click **Resource groups**

    This blade displays all of the resource groups that you have access to the Azure subscription.
